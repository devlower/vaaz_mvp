#### *Vaaz* is aware that some people might want to have kids, and some rather to have pets but what about people who like to have a beautiful garden full of plants?

#### It's really hard to take care of some plants, specially when you have multiple types of them in your house. Each one needs a specific humidity and temperature to bloom gracious and fiercely.

### The Solution!!!

#### *Vaaz* understands the need to help people take good care of your houseplants, even when you're on a vacation, your plants will be healthy and strong when you come back.

#### With *Vaaz* you will have access to your plant's healthy status, receive notifications when their water tank needs to be reloaded and even suggest an environment change if it's temperature is not in a good range.

###### *Vaaz* is an Interdisciplinary Academic Project for a course of Computer Science Degree at *Pontifícia Universidade Católica de Minas Gerais* - Campus *Poços de Caldas*
